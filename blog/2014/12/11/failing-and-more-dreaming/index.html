<div class="entry-content"><p>Failing IS part of living.</p>

<p>I’ve learned that I WILL make mistakes. No question about it.  In mistakes we grow, we learn, we succeed.  Miss Annalise keeps encouraging me to just try.  Accept that you will mess up.  Whew, that’s kind of relieving.</p>

<p>My analytical side wondered if she wanted me to teach myself because my questions were dumb.  Not true!  My teacher has introduced me to a whole new practice.  If I’m constantly relying on her to hold my hand and show me the way to do everything, how will I learn to troubleshoot problems on my own down the road?  I am challenged to encourage myself, take risks, and embrace learning.</p>

<p>Of course I still need others. We all need each other to lean on, to sharpen our skills, to share victories and losses.  However, only I can make choices in my life – choices to keep going, to keep searching for the solution, to keep trying no matter what.</p>

<p>And now about dreaming..</p>

<p>Recently, our class had a visitor from Adorable.io, a company I have fallen wildly in love with. Kevin shared how his love for people fuels his passion to work as a developer and designer. While sharing about his career path,  Kevin shared one thing he wish he knew back then – that he would have been more focused.  He did not have his eyes open to see opportunities presented to him  – opportunities which could have launched him into success much earlier.  After taking a round-a-bout way, he eventually landed a pretty sweet gig as the creative director at adorable. Now he encourages us to keep our eyes wide open and connect with people – for he believes that people are the essence of life.</p>

<p>Even today, I look at the opportunities before me.  Annalise has offered to mentor me in graphic design, if that is something I truly want to dedicate myself to after graduation.  I am honored by this invitation, and will seriously be considering it.  I have tinkered around with is the idea of going into graphic design.  Yet, having no experience whatsoever in that skill, I am timid to commit to such a complex field.  But oh, how I want to learn!  So, we will see what the new year brings, and perhaps I will begin working at a new dream!</p>

<p>Another cool opportunity I have discovered is the new “Hour of Code” program by Apple.  I’m very new to working at Apple, so all I know is that kids are learning how to code.  This simply amazes me that a young child can learn the same complicated stuff I am studying. Totally blown away! Who knows, maybe I can take part in teaching a class like this in the future!</p>
